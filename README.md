# RestaurantOrder Project
 
## Overview
This C program facilitates the management of customer orders in a restaurant setting. Users can input orders based on a preset menu, and the program calculates totals and taxes for each order. All orders are saved to a file, and a daily sales summary is generated.

## Features
- Dynamic menu display.
- Customer order input with item selection.
- Calculation of total order costs, including tax.
- Saving order details to a file.
- Generation of a daily sales summary file.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your machine.
2. Download the `restaurant_ordering_system.c` file.
3. Compile the program: `gcc -o restaurant_ordering_system restaurant_ordering_system.c`.
4. Execute the compiled application: `./restaurant_ordering_system`.

## How to Use
1. Start the program.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to display the menu and input orders.
3. After each order, decide whether to continue taking more orders.
4. Review the generated totals, taxes, and grand totals for each order.
